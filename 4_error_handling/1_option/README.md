# Workshop: Option

Use `cargo run` to run the project. Implement the unimplemented methods of `Inventory` to get the program to complete without errors.

## Hints

* `unimplemented!()` is just a function that panics when it is hit.
* Remember that usize is a numeric type used for indexing collections
* The `Vec` struct has a `remove` method that may be useful here
