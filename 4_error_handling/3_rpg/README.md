# Workshop: Option

Implement the `revive` and `cast_spell` methods. Uncomment one test case at a time from `main` to test your implementation. 

## Hints

* `unimplemented!()` is just a function that panics when it is hit.
* Remember that usize is a numeric type used for indexing collections
* You can `map` an `Option`
* Pattern matching alone can express most if not all of the desired behaviour in this exercise 

## Attribution

This task is closely based on Exercism's "role-playing" exercuse on the Rust track: https://github.com/exercism/rust/tree/main/exercises/concept/role-playing-game
