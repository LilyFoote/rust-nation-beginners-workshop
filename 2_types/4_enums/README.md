# Workshop: Enums

Use `cargo run` to run the project. Change the match statement in `execute_command` to get the assertions to pass. Do not change anything else.

## Hints

* Use the compiler errors to guide you. They will tell you exactly what is missing.
* You can add two `String`s using the `push_str` on one, and `as_str` on the other. 
* If you are using IntelliJ with the Rust plugin, it can generate the match arms for you.
