# Workshop: Enums

Use `cargo run` to run the project. Without changing the code in the main function make changes to get the program to compile and run successfully (with a 0 exit status).

There are seven test cases. After you get one passing, uncomment the next one until all seven are passing.

## Hints

* If you have a Rust plugin in your IDE it should be able to generate `use` statements (imports) automatically, eg by using alt+enter to get auto-complete suggestions.
  * May not work if the struct is not public
* As always listen to the compiler, it will provide helpful advice
*
