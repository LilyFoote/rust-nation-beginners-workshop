# Workshop: Enums

Use `cargo run` to run the project. Without changing the code in the main function make changes to get the program to compile and run successfully (with a 0 exit status).

There are seven test cases. After you get one passing, uncomment the next one until all seven are passing.

## Hints

* You will need to add an `impl` block for each struct
* Associated functions, such as `new`, do not need `self`. Check the example in the handouts
* The assertion in the first test is stringifying `Player` into the debug format. To pass the first test Player will need to be able to to be debug formatted.
* As always listen to the compiler, it will provide helpful advice
