# Workshop: Ownership

Use `cargo run` to run the project. One of the two functions `ban` and `print_banned_ingredients` needs a mutable reference and the other needs a read-only reference, but they may not be in the right order. Fix the program such that it compiles and prints a list of banned pizza toppings.

## Hints

* The collected works of Leo Tolstoy would be a bit dry 
* Remember you have to change the reference in two places, not one.
