# Workshop: Borrowing

Use `cargo run` to run the project. Refactor it to use references instead of exchanging ownership, such that ownership never leaves the `main` function.

## Hints

* After being moved to references, the two print functions will not need to return anything.
* Remember you have to make the change for the reference in two places, not one.
